            Kai,
            <br>
            <br>
            Holy Week is coming up. I guess that's the reason why I‚Äôm looping back and revisiting my Jesus phase. And gradually, I‚Äôm beginning to realize how unfairly I painted Pastor Boie as the villain in the situation. As Adam blamed the woman when God confronted him for his disobedience, I blamed our pastor for the faith I had lost.</p>
            <p>Truth of the matter is, months before that incident, I was already slipping away. The fervent faith I used to have was growing cold. I did everything‚Äîprayed, read my Bible more, listened to sermons. I was trying to keep my faith afloat. But I grew weary, and no help from heaven seemed to arrive. Slowly, without realizing it, I was wandering from the fold of God. Then Satan, being Satan, like a prowling lion seeking whom he may devour, tore me up.
                I‚Äôm not here to blame this evil entity for my misery. This is an attempt to put the puzzle pieces together and allow myself to process everything that has happened‚Äîthis time without shifting and projecting my pain onto others.
                So here is the tea, sisters‚Ä¶
            </p>
            <p>I grew impatient as He wouldn‚Äôt sanctify and rid me of my sins. (If you are a Christian, it‚Äôs your main objective as a believer to sin less. It is Christ or nothing.) 
                I was waiting in line for a dental check-up at BUPC during enrollment. Staring at the sky, I said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôd rather get struck by lightning than continue battling with my sins.‚Äù It‚Äôs either I die as a Christian or give in to the will of the flesh. A logical reasoning, I would argue. If I give in, I‚Äôd be toast‚Äîliterally‚Äîfor eternity, I may add.
            </p>
            <p>
                Months after that, a lightning bolt struck miles away from our house (an answered prayer I guess). My Bible was lying open, and instead of operating under the fear of the Lord and praying, I brushed it off. 
                My conscience was already seared. After that, I began getting sick. Doctors couldn‚Äôt figure out what was wrong. I wasn‚Äôt fully convinced that it was just a urinary tract infection. They ran all kinds of tests, but still no concrete diagnosis. I was paranoid. Judgment was upon me. Every day, I felt like I was living under the curses outlined in Deuteronomy 28. I think I still have it memorized. I listened to Paul Washer‚Äôs sermon on it quite a lot:
            </p>
            <blockquote>"The Lord sends upon you curses, confusion, and rebuke until you are destroyed and you perish quickly. The Lord smite you with madness and with blindness, and with bewilderment of heart, and you will grope at noon as a blind man gropes in darkness with none to save you. The Lord delights over you to make you perish and destroy you until you are torn from the land. Curse shall ye be in the city and curse shall ye be in the fields. Curse shall ye be when you come in and curse shall ye be when you go out. The heavens which is over your head shall be bronze, and the earth under you iron. You shall be a horror and a proverb and a taunt among people. Let all these curses come upon you and pursue you until you are destroyed, because you would not obey the Lord your God by keeping His statues and commandments to which He commanded you."</blockquote>
            <p>
                A taste of hell. It was mentally crushing. Then I concluded I had committed the unforgivable sin. 
            </p>
            <blockquote>‚ÄúFor it is impossible, in the case of those who have once been enlightened, who have tasted the heavenly gift, and have shared in the Holy Spirit, and have tasted the goodness of the word of God and the powers of the age to come, and then have fallen away, to restore them again to repentance, since they are crucifying once again the Son of God to their own harm and holding him up to contempt.‚Äù</blockquote>
            <p>
                There is more to it, but I don't wanna get too theological about it. So when Pastor Boie made me the focal point of his sermon and set me up as an example of what God does to a believer who fail to please God (you get sick or tragedy arrives) that was his ticket to ride the train of blame. I took it out all on him when I was grieving the God I crucified once again. 
            </p>
            <blockquote>"God is dead. God remains dead. And we have killed him. How shall we comfort ourselves, the murderers of all murderers? What was holiest and mightiest of all that the world has yet owned has bled to death under our knives: who will wipe this blood off us? What water is there for us to clean ourselves? What festivals of atonement, what sacred games shall we have to invent? Is not the greatness of this deed too great for us? Must we ourselves not become gods simply to appear worthy of it?" - Nietzsche </blockquote>
            <p>
                For two years, I shared the Christian hope that there is a purpose to this life and that all things will be made new. And when that positive outlook was shattered, I was once again directionless. Nothing made sense anymore. I was oscillating between wanting to die to see hell for myself and continuing to live as an apostate. It was paralyzing. Despite all that, I was still clinging to Him like an illegitimate child. But I made the decision: I couldn‚Äôt continue living like that. If I had already killed God, then I‚Äôd bury Him once and for all. Big statement.
                <br>
                <br>I started deconstructing. The things I experienced started to make sense from a philosophical and psychological point of view. Reading The Kybalion helped me wrap my head around the concept of God. All that to say, I don‚Äôt have a beef with religion or the Christian God. I learned my way through it. Plus, hymns are still my serenity song. Speaking of hymns‚Ä¶<br><br>It‚Äôs funny how my favorite hymns when I was a Christian were written by pious believers who fell away from their faith halfway through life. Horatio Spafford, writer of <i>It Is Well With My Soul</i>, abandoned his faith, moved to Jerusalem, and started a cult. Robert Robinson, writer of <i>Come Thou Fount of Every Blessing</i>, if my memory serves me right he became a Unitarian.
            </p>
            <blockquote>"Prone to wander, Lord, I feel it. Prone to leave the God I love."</blockquote> 
            <p>
                Subtle foreshadowing I guess. But spare me from building a cult. I don't have the ability and the capacity to deceive a lot of people. I couldn't even convince my friends to watch Avatar: The Last Air Bender and The Legend of Korraüò≠.<br>
                <br>Final verdict: I was never fit to be a Christian anyway. My unwillingness to yield, my tendency to question more than I believe, my inclination to move out of unpremeditated spontaneity‚Äîand I wouldn‚Äôt, couldn‚Äôt, give up the love I feel for another woman. I would have to strip myself of all these things that make me feel alive in order to enter the Wicket Gate? The consecrated life isn‚Äôt for me, brother. "The chief end of man is to glorify God and enjoy Him forever" is a maxim I cannot follow. My heaven is here. Any compensatory reward I‚Äôd get in the afterlife for giving my life to Christ wouldn‚Äôt amount to the joy of being alive‚Äîregardless of how fleeting my existence is.
